These data and codes are released concerning identification and control of Antagonistic Variable Stiffness Actuator (AVSA) setup.

Five compressed files have been provided for voltage differences of VD = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 V. 
Each compressed file include two files:
1) A Matlab .mat file containing PRBS input voltage and measured output link position data
2) A Matlab file (plot_result.m) for plotting the input and output data

Please place both files at the same directory and run the plot_result.m file to plot the PRBS voltage 
and link position for selected voltage difference.
